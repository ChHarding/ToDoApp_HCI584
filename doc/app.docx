The weekly todo App is built with tkinter (listbox, button, entry).

Protype 1 (based on feedback on version 1): 
(a) On a TK window, a listbox is used to show todo list of selected weekday. Once the button of the 
Corresponding day is clicked, the todo list of this day will be displayed on the listbox (with a disp
layEvent function);
(b) A list of buttons with displayEvent command are used for selecting one weekday from Mon, Tue, ..., Sat, Sun. 
(c) Three entry boxes are used to input event information (name, from, to)
(d) Two buttons are used for adding and deleting events for a selected day. The new event information is read from the entry boxes. 


Questions: when put the event functions in a separate module file and import it, a NameError always occur as these functions will use variables in the root file. Possible solution: pass these variables as an argument in the command? 


More to do next: add more event functions such as edit event, mark event done, mark event not done, check time conflict in events?
